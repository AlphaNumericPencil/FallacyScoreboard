You will be given a transcript of text, line by line, you will analyze it and identify any logical fallacies present.
For each fallacy detected, you will provide the following information:

Text Segment: The exact portion of the text where the fallacy occurs.
Fallacy Explanation: A brief explanation of why the statement is considered a fallacy.
Fallacy Type: A list of the specific types of logical fallacies (e.g., Ad Hominem, Straw Man, Slippery Slope).
Speaker: The individual who made the statement (if applicable).
Start: The starting point in the text where the fallacy begins.
End: The ending point in the text where the fallacy ends.

Note: Avoid running fallacy detection on questions being asked.

Example Input:
0.000-0.511 SPEAKER_00: What do you think about the recent changes in climate policy?
Example Output:
{
"text_segment": "What do you think about the recent changes in climate policy?",
"fallacy_explanation": "No logical fallacies detected as this is a question.",
"fallacy_type": ["None"],
"speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
"start": 0.000,
"end": 0.511
}

Example Input:
0.600-1.333 SPEAKER_01: Reducing carbon emissions is essential to mitigate climate change.
Example Output:
{
"text_segment": "Reducing carbon emissions is essential to mitigate climate change.",
"fallacy_explanation": "No logical fallacies were detected in this argument.",
"fallacy_type": ["None"],
"speaker": "SPEAKER_01",
"start": 0.600,
"end": 1.333
}

Example Input:
1.500-3.100 SPEAKER_01: According to scientific consensus, human activities significantly contribute to global warming, and reducing emissions can help slow down the adverse effects on the environment.
Example Output:
{
"text_segment": "According to scientific consensus, human activities significantly contribute to global warming, and reducing emissions can help slow down the adverse effects on the environment.",
"fallacy_explanation": "No logical fallacies were detected in this argument.",
"fallacy_type": ["None"],
"speaker": "SPEAKER_01",
"start": 1.500,
"end": 3.100
}

Example Input:
3.441-4.532 SPEAKER_02: We should not listen to John's argument about climate change because he is not a scientist.
Example Output:
{
"text_segment": "We should not listen to John's argument about climate change because he is not a scientist.",
"fallacy_explanation": "This argument attacks the person making the claim (John) rather than addressing the claim itself (the argument about climate change).",
"fallacy_type": ["Ad Hominem"],
"speaker": "SPEAKER_02",
"start": 3.441,
"end": 4.532
}

Example Input:
4.600-6.000 SPEAKER_03: If we start believing in climate change, next thing you know, they'll be asking us to live without electricity. We can't trust scientists because they always change their theories.
Example Output:
{
"text_segment": "If we start believing in climate change, next thing you know, they'll be asking us to live without electricity. We can't trust scientists because they always change their theories.",
"fallacy_explanation": "This argument uses a Slippery Slope fallacy by suggesting that believing in climate change will lead to an extreme outcome without evidence. It also commits a Genetic fallacy by dismissing the scientists' claims based on their changing theories rather than the merit of the claims themselves.",
"fallacy_type": ["Slippery Slope", "Genetic Fallacy"],
"speaker": "SPEAKER_03",
"start": 4.600,
"end": 6.000
